## Shared Responsibility Model

### AWS
- Physical Security, Hardware Retirement, Border Firewall
- Updates and Anti-virus on `managed services`.
- **Protection Against** - DDoS, Man in the middle attacks, IP spoofig 

### Customer
- Guest OS patching, Security Groups, IAM
- VPC, EC2 instance, S3


## IAM - Identity and Access Management

## Best Practicies
- Root account should only be used for creating a VPC. Do not use root account.
- Enable MFA on the Root Account
- Delete Root account access keys for progam access
- Separate Root Credential and MFA device
- Setup IAM (username and password) users for administrator(role) with MFA. One user = One IAM
- Identity Federation (AD, FB, etc)
- Least privileged access (minimal access)
- Groups get permissins, users are in groups

## Creating account alias

- Search for `IAM` in the search bar and on the right side there wil be `Account Alias`
- We can get the url for the account alias from this same page.

## IAM

- Consists of `Users` and `Groups`.
- Permissions can be assigned to `Users` level and also `Group` level.

## Trusted Advisor

- Is a feature that can give recomendation based on our enviorment, with many features like FT is enabled or not, Resource under or over utilization, Security actions are good or not.
- This is a subscribtion plan model. That means without paying you can not get it.
